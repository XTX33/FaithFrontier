## FAQ

### What does the Faith Frontier logo represent?
It’s a Christ-centered seal that expresses our faith commitments and the order of Christian life: the Father’s authority, the Son’s redemption, and the Spirit’s renewing work—expressed through restrained geometry and a consistent palette.

### Is Faith Frontier a church or a nonprofit?
Faith Frontier is a faith-rooted stewardship project with theological convictions. **Legal status depends on filings and jurisdiction.** We do not claim 501(c)(3) status unless and until such status is formally established.

### Why use a “seal” instead of a modern brand mark?
A seal communicates continuity, accountability, and seriousness. It signals that we’re trying to build durable trust—not a trend-driven brand.

### Why are there multiple crosses?
The center cross is Christ. The supporting crosses communicate witness and lived faith (renewal expressed through neighbor-care), while keeping Christ visually primary.

### Can I use the logo?
Yes for referencing Faith Frontier in good faith, using the official asset files and usage rules. Do not distort, recolor outside the palette, or remove elements.

### Does the logo have an “official” version?
Yes. Use the official SVG/PNG files in `/assets/logo/`. If you need a version for a specific background (light/dark/print), use the provided variants rather than editing the original.
