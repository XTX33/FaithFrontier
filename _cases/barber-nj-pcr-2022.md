  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This petition seeks post-conviction relief pursuant to
  <em>N.J. Ct. R. 3:22</em>, asserting violations of the
  <strong>Sixth Amendment</strong> right to effective counsel, the
  <strong>Fourteenth Amendment</strong> rights to due process and fundamental
  fairness, and <strong>Fifth Amendment</strong> protections against compelled
  or uninformed waiver of rights. The petition alleges
  <strong>ineffective assistance</strong>, <strong>failure to investigate</strong>,
  <strong>failure to disclose exculpatory and impeachment material</strong>,
  <strong>involuntary or insufficiently informed plea advisement</strong>,
  <strong>procedural defects</strong> affecting arraignment and pretrial stages,
  and other <strong>irregularities</strong> that cumulatively rendered the
  proceedings constitutionally unreliable.
</p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Key Legal Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Whether trial counsel’s performance violated the
    <em>Strickland v. Washington</em> / <em>State v. Fritz</em>
    standards for deficient performance and resulting prejudice.
  </li>

  <li>
    Whether counsel failed to investigate material facts, defenses, or
    witnesses in a manner that deprived petitioner of constitutionally
    adequate representation under the Sixth Amendment and New Jersey law.
  </li>

  <li>
    Whether exculpatory, mitigating, or impeachment evidence was withheld
    in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland</em> and related disclosure
    obligations applicable to the State.
  </li>

  <li>
    Whether any plea discussions, advisements, or waivers were involuntary
    or inadequately informed under <em>Boykin v. Alabama</em>,
    <em>State v. Slater</em>, and <em>State v. Henderson</em>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Whether structural or procedural irregularities during arraignment,
    pretrial proceedings, or case management deprived petitioner of due
    process and fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment
    and the New Jersey Constitution.
  </li>

  <li>
    Whether fragmentation, consolidation issues, or inconsistent handling
    across the related 2022 dockets violated principles of fundamental
    fairness and impaired petitioner’s ability to mount a unified defense.
  </li>

  <li>
    Whether cumulative errors—including ineffective assistance, nondisclosure,
    incomplete investigation, and irregular procedure—rendered the outcome
    unreliable under federal and state constitutional standards.
  </li>

  <li>
    Whether administrative delay, misrouting, or inconsistent processing of
    petitioner’s PCR filings undermined the remedial and corrective purpose
    of <em>N.J. Ct. R. 3:22-1 et seq.</em>
  </li>
</ul>
