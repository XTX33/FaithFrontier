## Case Overview

This case record maintains a factual, chronological archive for **A-000313-25**, an Appellate Division matter arising from a street-crossing conviction in Atlantic County.

Faith Frontier maintains this page to (1) preserve a coherent timeline, (2) centralize filings and orders for public inspection, and (3) reduce ambiguity created by fragmented or duplicated folders. This page is not a substitute for the official court docket; it is an indexed reference layer that points back to primary-source documents.

### Scope and Integrity Rules (Faith Frontier Standard)

- **Primary sources control.** Where a summary conflicts with an order, notice, filing stamp, or docket entry, the primary source controls and the summary must be corrected.
- **No assumptions.** If a fact (date, caption, originating docket, disposition) is not confirmed by a document, it is described as unconfirmed and left neutral.
- **Neutral tone.** This archive preserves claims and positions as asserted, while labeling them as assertions unless adjudicated.

## Procedural Posture

- **Forum:** Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division  
- **Posture:** Appeal docketed; the matter remains active pending scheduling/briefing directives and any further orders.

## Notes

- **Origin linkage:** This appeal is understood to arise from a street-crossing conviction in Atlantic County. If the originating docket number(s) are not confirmed by an appellate order, municipal judgment, or stamped filing, do not state them as fact—add them only once verified.
- **Folder consolidation:** Prior duplicate folders were removed to maintain a single source of truth and prevent conflicting summaries.
- **Next steps (administrative):** Monitor for briefing schedules, transcript/order designations, and any directives from the Appellate Division. Add each notice/order immediately upon receipt, preserving the original filename + filing date in the PDF name when possible.
