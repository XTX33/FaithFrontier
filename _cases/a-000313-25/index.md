### Scope and Integrity Rules (Faith Frontier Standard)

- **No assumptions.** If a fact (date, caption, originating docket, disposition) is not confirmed by a document, it is described as unconfirmed and left neutral.
- **Neutral tone.** This archive preserves claims and positions as asserted, while labeling them as assertions unless adjudicated.

## Notes

- **Origin linkage:** This appeal is understood to arise from a street-crossing conviction in Atlantic County. If the originating docket number(s) are not confirmed by an appellate order, municipal judgment, or stamped filing, do not state them as fact—add them only once verified.
- **Folder consolidation:** Prior duplicate folders were removed to maintain a single source of truth and prevent conflicting summaries.
- **Next steps (administrative):** Monitor for briefing schedules, transcript/order designations, and any directives from the Appellate Division. Add each notice/order immediately upon receipt, preserving the original filename + filing date in the PDF name when possible.
