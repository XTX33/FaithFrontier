Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust is a religious-purpose trust committed to sanctuary, agrarian stewardship, charitable service, and justice-oriented work for the people of New Jersey. Its mission is rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ, particularly the command to serve the hungry, the stranger, the sick, and the imprisoned (Matthew 25:35–40).

The Trust exists to steward places such as **Tillerstead Sanctuary** so that refuge is paired with responsibility, mercy with order, and compassion with meaningful work. Faith Frontier rejects exploitation, coercion, and disorder. Its theology affirms that healing is sustained through structure, accountability, and shared labor.

## Scripture for the times and seasons

Faith Frontier understands the present moment as one of social fracture, addiction, displacement, and institutional fatigue. Scripture speaks directly to such seasons.

* **Wisdom for turbulent times:**
  *“To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.”* (Ecclesiastes 3:1)
  The work of sanctuary recognizes that not all seasons call for the same response. Some require rest, others discipline; some require healing, others rebuilding.

* **Order amid confusion:**
  *“For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.”* (1 Corinthians 14:33)
  Sanctuary is not chaos. Structure, safety, and clear boundaries are essential to peace and restoration.

* **Stewardship over collapse:**
  *“Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.”* (1 Corinthians 4:2)
  Faith Frontier views land, buildings, labor, and lives as trusts—not assets to be extracted, but responsibilities to be guarded.

## Biblical anchors for the mission

* **Mercy joined to responsibility:**
  Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 25 calls His followers to feed, clothe, and welcome—but never to exploit, manipulate, or abandon accountability.

* **Proclaiming freedom and healing:**
  Christ announces good news to the poor and release to the oppressed (Luke 4:18–19). This informs outreach to people in addiction and crisis, paired with lawful care and professional oversight.

* **Repairing what is broken:**
  Isaiah names God’s people *“repairers of the breach”* (Isaiah 58:12). Tillerstead Sanctuary reflects this call through the literal restoration of a wounded property into a place of service and work.

* **Restoring cities, not extracting from them:**
  *“They shall rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them.”* (Amos 9:14)
  The former Atlantic Club—once a symbol of extraction and excess—is reimagined as a working sanctuary of craft, agriculture, and refuge.

* **Fruit that endures:**
  *“I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit—and that your fruit should remain.”* (John 15:16)
  Food production, skilled trades, and hospitality form visible fruit; restored lives and stable households form the deeper harvest.

* **Healing within ordered community:**
  Revelation’s vision of healing leaves and restored nations (Revelation 22:2) inspires spaces where healing flows within structure, safety, and shared responsibility.

## How scripture shapes the work

* **Sanctuary and prayer spaces**
  Quiet rooms, chapels, and community halls reflect the call to shelter, intercession, and discernment.

* **Lawful justice and civic navigation**
  Scripture commands justice tempered by wisdom (Micah 6:8). Legal education and civic assistance help neighbors stand lawfully and without coercion.

* **Trade training and craftsmanship**
  *“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord.”* (Colossians 3:23)
  Workshops in carpentry, tile, maintenance, and hospitality affirm work as dignity, not punishment.

* **Agriculture and provision**
  Indoor farming and microgreens embody stewardship of creation (Genesis 2:15) and practical provision for the community.

* **Recovery and healing**
  Structured partnerships with licensed providers reflect Christ’s healing ministry while honoring professional standards and lawful oversight.

## Accountability and public witness

Faith Frontier welcomes scrutiny. Scripture itself demands transparency:
*“Provide things honest in the sight of all men.”* (Romans 12:17)
