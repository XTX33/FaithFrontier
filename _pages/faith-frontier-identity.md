# Faith Frontier Identity & Beliefs

Faith Frontier is **Christian** and **non-denominational**. We follow **Jesus Christ** as Lord and Savior, confessing His **life, death, and resurrection**, and acknowledging Him as *the way, the truth, and the life* (John 14:6). We affirm the **Trinity** — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — and we are rooted in **Scripture**, guided by Biblical principles rather than bound to any single human denomination.

## How We Arrived Here

The founder of Faith Frontier was raised Catholic. That tradition provided structure and reverence, yet it was paired with experiences of hypocrisy and institutional failure. The foundation remains honored, but the walk now continues as a servant and witness of Christ outside rigid denominational labels. Faith Frontier exists to tell the truth, to guard conscience, and to build something faithful in an era that often forgets its Maker.

## Mission & Call

- Tell the truth without fear, with humility before God.
- Protect the vulnerable, especially those harmed by systems meant to serve them.
- Pursue justice and mercy in New Jersey — especially in Atlantic City — integrating faith, law, policy, and real-life story.
- Live as followers and witnesses of Jesus Christ, guided by the Holy Spirit and accountable to Scripture.

## Grounded in Atlantic City, New Jersey

Faith Frontier is rooted in **Atlantic City, New Jersey** — a coastal city where tourism and luxury sit beside poverty, addiction, and housing instability. Here, exploitation and homelessness collide with the hope of recovery and renewal. Coastal risk and instability shape daily life. Faith Frontier is a response to this reality: a commitment to justice, stewardship, practical mercy, ethical governance, and a sanctuary where people can seek Christ and safety.

## Walking Forward

We invite anyone who seeks Christ, who longs for integrity, and who wants to build lawful, ethical structures that serve real people. We are not partisan and do not campaign for political parties. We do seek justice, lawful reform, and faithful stewardship — trusting that God can redeem even the hardest ground.
