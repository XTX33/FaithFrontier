## What “Faith Frontier” means

Faith Frontier is the meeting place of justice, work, healing, agriculture, and civic life in New Jersey. It is the banner for sanctuary work that rebuilds ruined spaces and restores neighbors to dignity.

## What “Tillerstead Sanctuary” means

Tillerstead Sanctuary is the flagship site where the Faith Frontier vision takes physical form. It is the Atlantic Club redevelopment dream — a sanctuary of prayer, craftsmanship, agriculture, recovery, and lawful community empowerment.

## Approved phrases and tone

- Rebuild the Ruins
- Work, Harvest, Sanctuary
- Land of Milk and Honey — New Jersey
- Mercy, Craft, and Justice on the Atlantic Shore
- Sanctuary for Workers and Neighbors
- From Recovery to Work to Home
- Seeds, Skills, and Safe Sleep

Tone guidelines:

- **Faith-rooted and just:** Speak with hope and honesty about New Jersey’s needs.
- **Non-exploitative:** Avoid any hint of gambling imagery, sensationalism, or prosperity-gospel promises.
- **Local and lawful:** Emphasize respect for zoning boards, building codes, and worker protections.
- **Accessible language:** Use clear English; avoid jargon and insider terms.

## Verification and accountability

- **Provenance first:** Pair claims with dates, jurisdictions, and public-source links so readers can verify them independently.
- **Legal boundaries:** Distinguish faith convictions from legal advice, and default to licensed counsel for permitting, tax, and corporate matters.
- **Civic welcome:** Invite regulators, neighbors, and partners to review filings, visit sites, and suggest corrections; humility and openness are part of the brand.
- **No grievance theater:** Describe harms factually, avoid conspiracy framing, and keep the tone steady, documented, and solution-seeking.

All branding must reject exploitation, gambling motifs, and promises of easy riches. Imagery should point toward gardens, workbenches, prayer spaces, and community tables — never toward casino nostalgia or manipulative fundraising.
