## What “Faith Frontier” means

Faith Frontier is the meeting place of justice, work, healing, agriculture, and civic life in New Jersey. It is the banner for sanctuary work that rebuilds ruined spaces and restores neighbors to dignity.

## What “Tillerstead Sanctuary” means

Tillerstead Sanctuary is the flagship site where the Faith Frontier vision takes physical form. It is the Atlantic Club redevelopment dream — a sanctuary of prayer, craftsmanship, agriculture, recovery, and lawful community empowerment.

## Approved phrases and tone

- Rebuild the Ruins
- Work, Harvest, Sanctuary
- Land of Milk and Honey — New Jersey
- Mercy, Craft, and Justice on the Atlantic Shore
- Sanctuary for Workers and Neighbors
- From Recovery to Work to Home
- Seeds, Skills, and Safe Sleep

Tone guidelines:

- **Faith-rooted and just:** Speak with hope and honesty about New Jersey’s needs.
- **Non-exploitative:** Avoid any hint of gambling imagery, sensationalism, or prosperity-gospel promises.
- **Local and lawful:** Emphasize respect for zoning boards, building codes, and worker protections.
- **Accessible language:** Use clear English; avoid jargon and insider terms.

All branding must reject exploitation, gambling motifs, and promises of easy riches. Imagery should point toward gardens, workbenches, prayer spaces, and community tables — never toward casino nostalgia or manipulative fundraising.
