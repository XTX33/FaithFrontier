Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust (EIN issued) is a religious-purpose trust committed to sanctuary, agrarian, and justice work for New Jersey residents. We are pursuing the **Tillerstead Sanctuary** vision: redeveloping the former Atlantic Club into a lawful, multi-floor center that offers recovery support, trades training, dignified work, agriculture, legal navigation, and transitional housing.

We respectfully request collaboration, technical support, and financial assistance through appropriate redevelopment, workforce, and urban agriculture programs. Our commitments include:

- Complying with Atlantic City planning, zoning, building codes, and redevelopment plans.
- Prioritizing New Jersey residents for training, employment, and community equity participation.
- Partnering with licensed detox and rehab providers to ensure safe recovery services.
- Operating with transparent governance through the Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust.

Public benefits include hundreds of jobs, reduction of blight, expansion of recovery beds, locally grown food for the boardwalk, safer streets, and dignified housing for workers. We welcome site visits, feasibility discussions, and collaborative planning.
