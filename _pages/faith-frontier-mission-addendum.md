Faith Frontier exists to meet practical needs while honoring Christ’s commands. The sanctuary vision keeps Matthew 25 mercy at the center: food, drink, welcome, clothing, and companionship for people in distress. Luke 4’s promise of release for the oppressed becomes concrete through legal aid, recovery pathways, and honest work—always within court jurisdiction, licensing rules, and clear written agreements so that mercy never bypasses due process.

## Why exploitation is rejected

Casino-style profit depends on extracting from neighbors. Faith Frontier rejects exploitation because it violates justice and mercy. Wages, housing, and training must respect New Jersey labor and housing laws. People may receive prayer and pastoral care, but they will never be coerced into belief or labor. Civic regulators and workplace inspectors are welcome; transparency is part of discipleship and public accountability.

## How the mission expresses the gospel

- **Rehab and healing:** Partnerships with licensed detox and rehab providers, paired with pastoral support.
- **Work and housing:** Paid roles within the sanctuary, with clear wage standards and optional worker suites as part of lawful compensation.
- **Food and agriculture:** Microgreens, hydroponics, and meal programs that echo the abundance of Isaiah 58 and John 15.
- **Legal and civic help:** Navigation for benefits, identification, and court processes so neighbors can stand on their own feet.

All services are structured with consent, documentation, and clear boundaries between spiritual counsel and legal authority. Faith statements guide conscience; statutes and court orders guide compliance. Keeping both visible allows supporters, critics, and officials to verify integrity instead of taking it on trust.

The mission is open-handed: services are offered freely, without requiring religious conformity. Spiritual support is available for those who desire it, grounded in humility and respect.
