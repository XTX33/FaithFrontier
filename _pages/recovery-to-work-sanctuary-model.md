The pipeline at Tillerstead Sanctuary follows mercy and justice: every person is seen, every step is lawful, and no one is coerced.

## 1. Outreach & Intake

Street outreach, referrals from rehabs and detox centers, courts, and shelters lead people to intake. Assessments include safety, medical needs, and desire for recovery support.

## 2. Detox & Stabilization

Faith Frontier partners with licensed medical centers and detox facilities. The trust provides spiritual care, hospitality, and practical support while clinicians lead medical decisions.

## 3. Sanctuary Phase

Guests receive safe sleeping space, meals, basic clothing, and daily structure. Prayer and pastoral care are available to all, never forced on anyone.

## 4. Training Phase

Participants choose tracks in trades, agriculture, hospitality, facility maintenance, or administration. Workshops emphasize lawful jobsite practices, OSHA awareness, and craftsmanship.

## 5. Work Phase

Graduates step into paid employment at or above New Jersey minimum wage. Some roles include live-in worker suites as part of a transparent compensation package that complies with labor and housing law.

## 6. Graduation Phase

Participants exit with savings, help securing independent housing, job placement support, and alumni community connections.

## If someone declines to participate

People who refuse services are treated with dignity. They are not forced into labor or belief. When possible, a small blessing bag — food, socks, basic hygiene items — is offered, and they are released peacefully.

## Biblical roots

This model follows Matthew 25 hospitality and Luke 4 liberation. It offers Isaiah 58 rebuilding hope and John 15 fruit-bearing work. It is mercy without exploitation, rooted in faith and New Jersey law.
