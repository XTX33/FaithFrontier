Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust is a religious-purpose trust with an issued EIN. It holds the name, tools, and future acquisitions of Faith Frontier so that sanctuary, agrarian, and justice work remain protected for public benefit.

## Mission lock

- Dedicated to sanctuary, work, hospitality, agriculture, and legal empowerment for New Jersey residents.
- No gambling, predatory finance, or exploitative uses are allowed on trust-held properties or brands.
- A 100-year dedication ensures that sites like **Tillerstead Sanctuary** remain focused on mercy, work, and lawful community support.

## Governance

- **Trustee:** Devon Tyler serves as founding trustee.
- **Advisory roles (to be built as the sanctuary grows):**
  - Ecclesiastical and pastoral advisors
  - Community advisors rooted in Atlantic City and across New Jersey
  - Trade and workforce advisors
  - Ethics and compliance advisors for legal and financial integrity

## Compliance and transparency

The Trust operates within New Jersey and federal law, even as it remains ecclesiastical in nature. Intellectual property and assets are held for public benefit, and partnerships will be documented through transparent agreements.
