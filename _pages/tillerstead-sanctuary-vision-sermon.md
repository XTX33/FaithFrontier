The Atlantic Club is a ruin of the old casino economy. Its rooms once chased profit from people who could least afford to lose. Faith Frontier looks at the same walls and imagines a sanctuary of mercy, work, and harvest. We do not come to take from New Jersey; we come so New Jersey residents can prosper together.

The prophets spoke of ruins rebuilt (Isaiah 58; Amos 9:14). Jesus declared good news to the poor and freedom for the oppressed (Luke 4:18–19). Those words guide the work. The sanctuary we imagine is not a fantasy — it is a disciplined, lawful, and patient redevelopment carried out with planners, engineers, and neighbors.

Picture the ground floor alive with prayer, meals, and microgreens grown upstairs. Picture tradespeople teaching tile, carpentry, and hospitality on mid-level floors. Picture detox partners stabilizing people who are ready for a new start. Picture worker suites where graduates rest without fear. This is work, not spectacle. It is Matthew 25 mercy paired with John 15 fruit.

We refuse to exploit the people of this state. Wages, housing, and training will meet or exceed legal standards. Services will welcome all, without coercing belief. Faith Frontier is faith-rooted, but it exists to serve.

May God guide every permit hearing, every inspection, and every partnership. May He open doors that align with justice, and close paths that would harm New Jersey’s people. May Tillerstead Sanctuary rise as a place of refuge, craft, and harvest on this Atlantic shore. Amen.
