# Faith Frontier Brand & Tone Guide

This guide sets tone and editorial standards for Faith Frontier content, rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ and the witness tradition embodied in the Geneva Bible.

## Core Principles
- Christ-centered: elevate justice, mercy, humility (Micah 6:8; Matthew 5–7).
- Truthful witness: careful provenance, clear citations, and plain speech.
- Charity in conflict: critique systems, not persons; avoid derision.
- Covenant over contract: emphasize duty, stewardship, and good faith.
- Public trust: prioritize transparency, accessibility, and verifiability.

## Voice & Style
- Reverent, direct, and plain-language; avoid jargon.
- Use scripture references sparingly and contextually.
- Prefer active voice and concrete facts over speculation.
- Where uncertainty exists, disclose it and invite review.

## Editorial Checks
- Provenance: include `source_url`, `received_via`, `provenance_note` in front matter/data.
- Accessibility: ensure PDFs are readable; prefer text-searchable assets.
- Integrity: compute and publish checksums for docket PDFs.
- Privacy: redact sensitive personal data unless essential for public interest.

## Page Elements
- Header crest: use the Faith Frontier seal in `_includes/header.html`.
- Footer tagline: "Soli Deo Gloria · Lex Dei Supra · Covenant over Contract".
- Maintenance banner: use `maintenance-banner.html` for notices.

## Citations
- Use descriptive labels; include dates and jurisdictions.
- Align with Geneva Bible tone: sober, faithful, and accountable.

## Community Standards
- Invite feedback through `contact.md`; respond respectfully.
- Publish weekly changelog summaries of public record updates.
