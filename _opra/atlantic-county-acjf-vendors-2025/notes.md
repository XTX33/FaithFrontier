visibility: "Internal working notes; publish only if appropriate"

## Scope of notes (non-findings)

This file is used to track:
- what was requested,
- what was produced,
- what was withheld/redacted (and the stated reason),
- follow-up actions needed (clarifications or narrower subsequent requests).

These notes do not assert factual findings. They are an organizational aid to ensure records remain explainable and auditable.

## Working checklist

### After filing
- Save each NJ OPRA Machine confirmation email/receipt as PDF.
- Store receipts in `/requests/` and log the date in `timeline.yml`.

### After any extension
- Save extension notice as PDF.
- Log the extension date and the new promised production date in `timeline.yml`.

### After any production
- Store produced documents in `/responses/` with clear filenames.
- If a redaction index is provided, store it alongside the production.
- Log production date and a short description in `timeline.yml`.

### If records are denied or heavily redacted
- Confirm whether the denial is:
  - “no records,”
  - “records exempt,”
  - “records not maintained,” or
  - “overbroad request / clarification required.”
- Prepare a focused clarification request referencing the custodian’s stated basis.
- Preserve all communications in `/correspondence/`.

## Questions to answer using documents (not assumptions)

- Which vendors are providing core services (medical, food, telecom, commissary, maintenance)?
- Which contracts were competitively bid vs. no-bid/emergency/cooperative?
- What monitoring and performance provisions exist (audits, KPIs, cure periods)?
- What deficiencies or corrective action records exist, if any?
- What governance role does each entity play (Sheriff’s Office vs County vs ACIA)?
- What modernization or system upgrade planning exists (and where does it sit: County vs ACIA)?

## Publication discipline

If this record is published publicly:
- publish primary documents and the timeline,
- keep interpretive analysis separate from the index page,
- avoid conclusions not directly supported by the records.
