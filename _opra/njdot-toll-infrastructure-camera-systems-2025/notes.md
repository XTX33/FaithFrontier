## Scope of notes (non-findings)

Track what was requested, what was produced, what was withheld/redacted (and the stated reason), and any follow-up actions needed.

## To-do (once response arrives)

- Save the response package into `/responses/`
- Log the response date in `timeline.yml`
- If any redactions occur, save any redaction index or explanation
- If the agency refers you to NJTA / Turnpike / E-ZPass entities, create a parallel OPRA record for that custodian
