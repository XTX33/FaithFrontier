# How We Discern Properties

Faith Frontier’s property selection process is transparent, ethical, and mission-driven. We use only compliant, API-based data sources and a public scoring model to evaluate each candidate property.

## Our Criteria

- **Stewardship & Land:** Lot size, flood risk, soil, water access, and distance from industrial impact.
- **Housing & Human Dignity:** Habitability, ADU/multi-unit potential, and neighborhood stability.
- **Rehab & Construction Feasibility:** Estimated rehab tier, permit complexity, and utility status.
- **Risk & Governance:** Title/tax risk, zoning ambiguity, and environmental red flags.

## Our Process

1. **Ingestion:** We gather property data only from approved, standards-based APIs (never scraping or unauthorized feeds).
2. **Scoring:** Each property is scored using a transparent, explainable model. Scores include written rationales for every decision.
3. **Shortlisting:** Properties meeting our mission and compliance thresholds are published in anonymized shortlists.
4. **Governance:** All decisions are logged and auditable. Faith Frontier Trust and Tillerstead LLC operate independently, with clear legal and financial separation.

## Why This Matters

- **Transparency:** Every step is documented and replayable.
- **Compliance:** We never use data or methods that violate terms of service or law.
- **Stewardship:** Our approach prioritizes land health, human dignity, and ethical construction.
