<!-- Sanctuary Section: Legal Safeguards & Ethical Protection -->

# Legal Safeguards & Ethical Protection

This section gathers the policies, notices, and procedures that protect the Sanctuary, the founder, participants, and vulnerable neighbors. We set trauma-aware, Christlike boundaries: no harassment, no threats, no exploitation, no abuse. Persistent disruption or harm may result in removal or refusal of participation.

All safeguards honor the authority of Jesus Christ and remain subject to the laws of New Jersey and the United States. Discreet and lawful measures may be used to protect safety, privacy, and property. They are aimed at stewardship and order — never retaliation or unlawful force.

Future content will include conduct expectations, safety protocols, participation rules, and ethical statements for ministry-adjacent activity such as referrals, advocacy, and documentation.
