# Outreach & Works of Mercy

Faith Frontier serves Atlantic City and New Jersey with practical mercy. This section will outline rehab and detox connections, pathways to work and skill-building, housing-help referrals, community-care projects, and volunteer partnerships. Everything is grounded in Biblical justice and a Christ-centered desire to help people move from harm toward healing.

We cannot help everyone, and we will not enable exploitation, but we will serve all who genuinely seek transformation and are willing to walk in good faith.
