# Sanctuary Identity & Foundation

Faith Frontier is a Christian, non-denominational witness to Jesus Christ. We confess His life, death, and resurrection; we affirm the Trinity; and we walk under Scripture as our guide. Raised in tradition and refined by adversity, we choose devotion over empty labels and name Jesus Christ as the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

For the full statement of faith and context, read the [Faith Frontier Identity & Beliefs]({{ '/about/faith-frontier-identity/' | relative_url }}) page. The Sanctuary exists to keep that identity honest, prayerful, and accountable — especially in Atlantic City and across New Jersey.
