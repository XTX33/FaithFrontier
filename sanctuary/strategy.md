<!-- Sanctuary Section: Strategy & Builder's Table -->

# The Builder’s Table (Strategy, Projects & Foresight)

Here faith meets planning, law, and construction. This section will host property rehabilitation proposals, community-care models, ethical governance plans, and foresight documents that serve Atlantic City, New Jersey, and beyond. It is a working table for long-term solutions that honor Scripture, conscience, and the people who need shelter and stability.

Expect drafts, experiments, and structured plans — all submitted under the authority of Jesus Christ and designed to steward resources wisely.
