# Security, Stewardship & Safe-Entry Protocols

A Christian sanctuary requires hospitality and discernment. This section explains how Faith Frontier protects people and property with love, wisdom, and lawful order. We will address walk-ins, disruptive or abusive behavior, safety concerns, and property protection while honoring the dignity of every person.

We tolerate no harassment, threats, or exploitation. Those who persistently harm others may be refused entry or asked to leave. Discreet, lawful security measures may be used to keep everyone safe. They exist for stewardship and safety — never retaliation or unlawful force — and always in submission to Jesus Christ and the laws of New Jersey and the United States.
