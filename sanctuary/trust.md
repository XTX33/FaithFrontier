<!-- Sanctuary Section: Governance & Trust Formation -->

# Sanctuary Governance & Trust Formation

This section gathers the legal, ethical, and spiritual framework for Faith Frontier and any Ecclesiastical Trust or related entity. It will document purpose and mission, trusteeship, governance, decision-making, recordkeeping, and stewardship of property or funds. All of it is submitted to Jesus Christ and remains accountable to the laws of New Jersey and the United States.

Future additions may include draft trust language, minutes, resolutions, and governance policies designed to protect the Sanctuary and those it serves.
