# Prayer Room & Devotion

This is the inner room of the Sanctuary — a place to lay burdens down and lift prayers up. Here we seek Jesus Christ together through Scripture, worship, intercession, and honest testimony. We pray for Atlantic City, for New Jersey, and for anyone carrying the weight of addiction, homelessness, exploitation, or bureaucratic harm.

Future additions may include written prayers, Scriptures for meditation, testimonies of God’s provision, and intercession for justice and mercy.
