### Preamble and Intent
The Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust is established as a spiritual stewardship vessel dedicated to prayer, sanctuary hospitality, agrarian work, and justice-minded service. This instrument affirms that the name, resources, and commitments of Faith Frontier are held in trust for God’s purposes and the relief of neighbors.

### Articles of Dedication
1. **Mission Lock:** All property, accounts, and operational authority held by the trust are bound to sanctuary, agrarian, charitable, and justice-oriented purposes in alignment with Scripture.
2. **Stewardship and Pastoral Care:** Trustees carry pastoral responsibility to guard against exploitation, predation, or commercial misuse of the trust’s name, holdings, and relationships.
3. **Transparency and Counsel:** Significant decisions invite prayer, counsel, and documentation so that sanctuary partners may discern the integrity of actions taken.

### Governance Notes
- This formation instrument is kept within the Sanctuary inner room for ecclesiastical recordkeeping.
- Amendments, banking resolutions, and minutes will be appended as subsequent trust documents.
- Readers with questions about context or interpretation may request clarification through Faith Frontier’s pastoral team.
