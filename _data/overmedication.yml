  - id: opioids
    name: "High-dose opioid painkillers (oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine ER)"
    stat_value: "43 retail prescriptions per 100 residents (CDC retail pharmacy data, 2022)"
    annual_scripts_millions: 131
    profit_driver: "Volume bonuses + satisfaction scores rewarded chronic refills even when evidence only supports short-term trauma care."
    harm: "Opioid-involved overdoses killed 80,411 Americans in 2023; southern states sell double the national rate."
    nature_lineage: "Morphinan alkaloids were isolated from the opium poppy; whole-plant allies such as turmeric, ginger, and rosemary supply anti-inflammatory relief without respiratory depression."
    supportive_plants: ["turmeric", "ginger", "rosemary"]
  - id: benzodiazepines
    name: "Fast-acting benzodiazepines (alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam)"
    stat_value: "66 million prescriptions in 2023; 50% of Medicare benzo users also receive an opioid (HHS OIG)."
    annual_scripts_millions: 66
    profit_driver: "Automatic refills for anxiety keep patients on-label beyond 2–4 weeks because sedation scores are tied to clinic ratings."
    harm: "Combined benzos + opioids quadruple overdose risk and accelerate memory decline in elders."
    nature_lineage: "Benzodiazepines target GABA receptors that are also modulated by aromatic herbs like tulsi, chamomile, and lavender."
    supportive_plants: ["tulsi", "chamomile", "lavender"]
  - id: ppi
    name: "Chronic proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole)"
    stat_value: "Up to 70% of long-term users lack a valid indication (JAMA Internal Medicine, 2017)."
    annual_scripts_millions: 115
    profit_driver: "Maintenance therapy is marketed indefinitely even though lifestyle + short tapers resolve most reflux."
    harm: "Extended use raises risk of nutrient depletion, kidney injury, and gut infections."
    nature_lineage: "Modern antacids mimic mucilaginous and anti-inflammatory plants such as chamomile, ginger, and aloe."
    supportive_plants: ["chamomile", "ginger", "aloe"]

lineage:
  - drug: "Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)"
    origin: "Salicin in white willow (Salix alba) inspired the synthetic."
    takeaway: "Whole-bark teas deliver the same salicylates with tannins that buffer the stomach."
  - drug: "Morphine / Oxycodone"
    origin: "Isolated from opium poppy latex before being acetylated and patented."
    takeaway: "Plants like turmeric, ginger, and rosemary calm the same inflammatory cascades without respiratory suppression."
  - drug: "Metformin"
    origin: "Galegine alkaloids in French lilac (Galega officinalis) informed biguanides."
    takeaway: "Fiber- and bitter-rich greens lower glucose swings alongside clinical care."
  - drug: "Digoxin"
    origin: "Digitoxin glycosides concentrated from foxglove flowers."
    takeaway: "Plants demand respect—dosage discipline is sacred whether the molecule is in a lab or a leaf."
  - drug: "Paclitaxel"
    origin: "Harvested first from the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia)."
    takeaway: "Regenerative forestry, not patent games, keeps life-saving compounds available."
