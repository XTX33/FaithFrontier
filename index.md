        Faith Frontier builds a sacred public trust so New Jersey residents can defend due process, honor conscience,
        and seek restoration. We document hard cases, stand with families inside complex systems, and keep every action

    <h2 class="section-heading">Faith Frontier translates hard cases into hopeful systems.</h2>
    <p class="section-lead">
      Faith Frontier is an ecclesiastical, faith-rooted public trust committed to New Jersey's people. We acknowledge the
      harms we have witnessed -- confusing hearings, paperwork traps, agencies that miss humanity -- and we turn those
      lessons into a constructive path forward.
    </p>
    <p style="color: var(--color-muted);">
      We follow Christ's call to justice, mercy, and humility (cf. Matthew 5–7), anchoring our public recordkeeping in
      the witness tradition of the Geneva Bible while inviting transparent comparison across translations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are building an ethical advocacy culture: documenting cases, equipping residents with plain-language guidance,
      and collaborating with churches, community leaders, professionals, and officials who want due process to work for
      everyone. Our focus is restoration, stewardship, and public trust.
