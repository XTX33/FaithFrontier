# Faith Frontier Logo

### Symbolism • Theology • Design • Usage Standards

The Faith Frontier emblem is a **modern ecclesiastical seal** — a visual covenant of our mission and public trust. It is built as a layered SVG: a white central Cross, embraced by a gold halo (covering), with two green crosses set behind the main form. Each element is intentional and doctrinally grounded.

---

## 1) Gold Halo Covering (Outer Ring)

**Symbolizes:** God the Father — eternal, sovereign, holy.

- The unbroken circle signifies eternity and completeness (Isaiah 57:15).
- Gold conveys kingship, sanctity, and the unchanging glory of God.
- As a “covering,” the ring expresses the Father’s protective authority in which our life and work are held.

**Design notes:** The halo sits above other elements, framing the Cross and centering the composition. Maintain clear space equal to the ring’s thickness on all sides in usage.

---

## 2) White Central Cross

**Symbolizes:** Jesus Christ — the Son, crucified and risen; Light of the world.

- White communicates purity, mercy, and resurrection hope.
- Proportions are softened to be approachable without diminishing reverence.
- When set within the gold halo, the Cross reads as light proceeding from the Father (John 8:12; Hebrews 1:3).

**Design notes:** Stroke and arm ratios are tuned for legibility at small sizes. Do not alter arm lengths or corner radii.

---

## 3) Two Green Crosses Behind the Main Cross

**Symbolizes:** New creation and neighbor‑care lived by the Spirit.

- Green represents life, growth, cultivation, and stewardship (Psalm 1; 2 Corinthians 5:17).
- The two crosses form a grounded foundation — a double witness to our calling: love God and love neighbor (Matthew 22:37–39).
- Set behind the white Cross, they affirm that all renewal is anchored in Christ, not apart from Him.

**Design notes:** The green crosses are offset and subdued so they support, never compete, with the white Cross. Keep their tones darker than the gold and white for proper hierarchy.

---

## Composition and Geometry

- The gold ring diameter sets the visual boundary; the white Cross is centered within it.
- Cross arm thickness ≈ ring thickness for harmony; spacing is balanced so the Cross breathes inside the halo.
- The green crosses align to the central grid and remain clipped by the ring when used in circular marks.

---

## Color Guide (Brand Palette)

- Gold Halo: warm gold (divinity, kingship)
- White Cross: pure white (mercy, resurrection)
- Green Crosses: deep greens (growth, sanctuary, stewardship)

Use high contrast backgrounds. If the mark sits on photos, add a soft neutral field to preserve clarity.

---

## Usage Standards (Do/Don’t)

**Do:**
- Keep layers: gold ring above, white Cross central, green crosses behind.
- Preserve proportions and clear space.
- Use brand colors without gradients unless the official asset includes them.

**Don’t:**
- Re‑color the white Cross or gold halo.
- Remove the green foundation crosses in the seal variant.
- Distort geometry, add outlines, or place on low‑contrast backgrounds.

---

## Theological Grounding (Selected Texts)

- Eternity and holiness — Isaiah 57:15
- Light of the world — John 8:12
- Power of the Cross — 1 Corinthians 1:18
- New creation — 2 Corinthians 5:17
- Planted by streams, bearing fruit — Psalm 1
- Love God, love neighbor — Matthew 22:37–39

## Summary

Our seal brings doctrine into design: the **gold halo** of the Father’s covering, the **white Cross** of the Son at the center, and the **two green crosses** behind as the lived witness of renewal and neighbor‑care in the Spirit. Keep the hierarchy, honor the meanings, and the emblem will speak clearly in every context.
