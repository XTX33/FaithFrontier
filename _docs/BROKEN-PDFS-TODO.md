# PDF Content To-Do

This checklist is maintained in the internal workspace. See:

- `_internal/BROKEN-PDFS-TODO.md`

## Action Required

Replace placeholder PDFs with the actual documents.

## How to Upload

1. Obtain the actual PDF files
2. Replace the placeholder files in the respective directories
3. Commit and push the changes
4. Verify the links work on the published site

**Note:** Until these files are uploaded, the links to these documents will result in broken/corrupted PDF downloads.
